# Preface

It must have been an intellectually exhilarating moment in history when 
electrical engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and others were uncovering the
set of interrelated concepts that would eventually coalesce into what we think 
of today as computer science. If you listen to the people in the 
communities of statistics, machine learning, data visualization, and computer 
science it's apparent that another exciting moment is taking place around the
new discipline of data science. The necessity that brought about the birth of 
modern computer science was at first clear with Turing's electromechanical
implementation of Church's lambda calculus, but then the need for computers
remained non-obvious to the general public well into the PC era. In contrast
the public's understanding of the importance of data is constantly talked about
in the media, and every industry and government is adapting to the torrents of
data they're collecting for purposes as commercial as selling products or as
serious as apprehending criminals. Despite the widely recognized importance of
data the production of new data is on a course to out-pace the number of people
qualified to analyze that data. It's easy to imagine a nightmare scenario where
the cure for a terrible cancer is sitting in a database that not enough people 
have the time or expertise to analyze. The only way I can see to avoid such a 
situation in the future is to make educational materials for data science that
are high in quality, widely accessible, free, and open.
